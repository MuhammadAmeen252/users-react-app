# Users Management React App
Its a simple react app that views users data in the admin dashboard and admin can perform CRUD operations on the data. I used JWT for authentication using Local storage, redux-toolkit for state management, react-infinite-scroll-component for  fetching new data on scrolling, tailwand CSS for styling, formik and yup for form handling and validation,  axios for handling API requests and react-router-dom for routing.

## Starting the application
In the project directory, you run:
1. npm install
2. npm start
